To add Pop to the project via CocoaPods (and this possibly works for other frameworks too):

add the following lines to the Podfile in the root of the project:

    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
    pod 'pop', '~> 1.0'

Then, in the Pods Project, in the reDiscover workspace, change:

in the Target Pods-chromaprint-osx-static 
    make sure Header Search Paths is empty
    make sure User Header Search Paths has
        "${PODS_ROOT}/Headers"

in the target Pods-pop
    in the Header Search Paths remove all but
        "${PODS_ROOT}/Headers/Private"
        "${PODS_ROOT}/Headers/Public"

To add Argo support 

add the following lines to the Podfile in the root of the project:

use_frameworks!
pod 'Argo'

NOTE! 
When adding use_frameworks! to the podfile we need to:

    Remove the #include "chromaprint.h" from the reDiscover-Bridging-Header.h 

    In the reDiscover Project's reDiscover target Build Settings Header Search Paths 
    add the line ${PODS_ROOT}/ffmpeg-osx-static
