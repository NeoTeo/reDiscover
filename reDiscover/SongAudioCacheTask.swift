/**
A CacheTask represents a unit of work that will cache a number of songs.
`TGSongAudioCacheTask` initiates the construction of a cache based on its given
context and waits for the caching to be done before returning. This is so that
the caller doesn't set too many tasks in motion that cannot be (as easily)
cancelled.

Eg. if we set 10 tasks going (by moving quickly over that many different
songs) and we create 10 tasks that return as soon as they have started but before
having finished caching, we have no (easy) way of interrupting a remote load
of a resource.

`TGSongAudioCacheTask` also tries to reuse what it can from the given oldCache
to avoid re-caching.
